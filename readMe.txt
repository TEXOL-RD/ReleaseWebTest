1. We need to experiment with creating a Texol configuration web page on docker, so we need to create a docker imgic file first.
2. WebAPI.go in the /go folder needs to be able to be executed
3. The index.html in /html has currently created a test file. If you enter 127.0.0.1:8080 as the URL in the web page, the port will be automatically opened through WebAPI.go.
